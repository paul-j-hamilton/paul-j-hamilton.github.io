I am a first-year PhD student in the Technology & Operations Management (TOM) unit at Harvard Business School. I am advised by [Iavor Bojinov](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1199332) and [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). I am a part of the AI4LIFE research group led by Hima under Harvard's D^3 Initiative. 

My research interests lie in the broad areas of explainable AI, digital transformation, and data science operations. I work on research that explores how stakeholders within organizations can use AI to make better decisions. In particular, I am studying how domain experts use model explanations to reconcile their subject-area expertise with the predictions of AI systems. I also study how firms are using data science and AI to transform their business operations. This includes the following questions:

+ How can management drive adoption of data science? How can firms build internal trust of AI systems? 
+ How should firms structure data lakes and data warehouses? How does data governance affect the success of data science initiatives?
+ How do firms stay up-to-date on new capabilities in AI? How is knowledge related to data science and machine learning shared throughout organizations? I am particularly insipred by the concept of [absorptive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorptive_capacity).
