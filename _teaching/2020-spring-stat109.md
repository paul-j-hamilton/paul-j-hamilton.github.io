*Teaching Fellow*

Stat  109  is  a  second  course  in  statistical  inference  and  is  a  further  examination  of  statistics  and  data analysis  beyond  the  introductory  course.    Topics  include  t‐tools  and  permutation‐based  alternatives including bootstrapping, analysis of variance, linear regression, model checking and refinement. Statistical computing and simulation based emphasis will also be covered as well as basic programming in  the  R  statistical  package.  Emphasis  is  made  on  thinking  statistically,  evaluating  assumptions,  and developing tools for real‐life applications. Note that Stat 109 cannot be taken for credit if Stat 139 has already been taken.  
 
By the end of the course, students should be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of statistical techniques appearing in the media, scientific literature, or students’ own work. Given a data set, students should be able to:

+ state hypotheses;

+ explore the data using statistical software; 

+ determine which statistical model may be appropriate;

+ apply corresponding hypotheses tests;

+ check the assumptions behind these tests and models;

+ interpret the results of the analysis to draw conclusions about the hypotheses.
